	     <p>
	       내가 좋아하는 아일랜드 음식 중 일부입니다!

    		  <h2>아일랜드식 전통 아침식사</h2>
    	    <p>
    	      A "Full Irish" breakfast consists of sausages, rashers (bacon),
    	      eggs, black pudding, white pudding and toast.
    	    </p>
    	    <p>
    	      Often there will be a grilled tomato as well as mushrooms,
    	      and baked beans.
    	    </p>
    	    <p>
    	      And of course, no breakfast is complete without a lovely pot 
    	      of tea!

    		  <h2>뱅거와 매시</h2>
    		  <p>
    		    This classic of sausages, mashed potato and gravy is not
    		    unique to Ireland, but what makes it special is the Irish
    		    sausages. Most countries have their own way of making sausages,
    		    and they are one thing I miss from home if I'm away travelling!

  		    <h2>베이컨과 양배추</h2>
  		    <p>
  		      I couldn't possibly make a list of Irish food without including
  		      this very traditional dish!
  		    </p>
  		    <p>
  		      It might not sound very interesting, but this hearty meal of
  		      boiled ham, potatoes and green cabbage is tasty and filling.
  		      I love to smother the potatoes in butter, and I also like a
  		      little mustard with the bacon.
  		    </p>
  		    <p>
  		      My mum always made it extra special by cooking the cabbage in
  		      the water that the ham was boiled in.
  		    </p>
  		    <p>
  		      If there are any leftovers you can make another one of my
  		      favourites: <strong>fried cabbage</strong>!
