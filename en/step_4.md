## Organising your page

+ So far you've used **headings** and **paragraphs** to make your **content** look tidy and easy to read. Let's make it even more organised by grouping things together.
 
**Content** is all the "stuff" on your web page, like information and pictures

+ Go to the `attractions.html` file \(or one of your own pages if you're not using the example Trinket project\). Near the top, just **underneath** the opening `<main>` tag, type the following on a new line: 

```html
  <main>
    <article>
```

+ Delete the closing tag that Trinket automatically adds in for you.

+ At the bottom of the file, just **above** the closing `</main>` tag, add a new line and close the `article` element:

```html
  </article>
    </main>
```

Think of the `article` element as a **container** for a piece of content, in this case a set of information about attractions in my home country, Ireland. If you have different bits of content that aren't related, you should put each one into its own `article` element instead of putting one set of the tags around the whole lot.

Remember when you created a menu and then put it in between `<nav> </nav>` tags? That's another example of a type of container. What you are doing is telling the browser that everything in between these tags belongs together. Like organising things in boxes and shelves in your home!

```html
  <article>
    <h1>My favourite places to see in Ireland</h1>
      <h2>The Cliffs of Moher</h2>
      <p>
      The Cliffs of Moher are found in County Clare, where I am from. Look how cool they are!</p>
      <img src="cliffs.JPG" alt="The Cliffs of Moher" height="200px" />
      <h2>Achill Island</h2>
      <p>This is a large island off the coast of County Mayo. It has a wild and
      beautiful landscape of mountains, bogs and cliffs.
      </p>
      <img src="achill.JPG" width="200px" />
  </article>
```

+ Now look at the content in your `article`: can you break it up into chunks or sections? Another HTML element called `section` lets you do exactly this! I've put the information about each different attraction in between its own set of `<section> </section>` tags:

```html
  <article>
    <h1>My favourite places to see in Ireland</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>The Cliffs of Moher</h2>
      <p>
      The Cliffs of Moher are found in County Clare, where I am from. Look how cool they are!</p>
      <img src="cliffs.JPG" alt="The Cliffs of Moher" height="200px" />
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Achill Island</h2>
      <p>This is a large island off the coast of County Mayo. It has a wild and
      beautiful landscape of mountains, bogs and cliffs.
      </p>
      <img src="achill.JPG" width="200px" />
    </section>
  </article>
```

Once your content has been organised into `article`s and `section`s you can create CSS rules in the stylesheet to control how the different bits look! 

+ Here's some example CSS styling. See if you can understand it and then make some of your own.

```css
  section {
    border-top-style: solid;
    border-top-width: 2px;
    border-top-color: #F5FFFA;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
  }

  article {
    border-radius: 10px;
    background-color: #48D1CC;
    padding: 10px;
  }
```

+ Have a go at organising all of your HTML files in this way. In my example I've added an `article` with a bunch of `section`s onto the Food page. On the next card you'll design a different theme for each page that's organised into `articles` and `section`s!
