## Getting Setup

1. This Sushi Card series uses Trinket for writing the website code. If you do not have an account on Trinket, it is recommended that you create one. It is free: all you need is an email address. Go to [dojo.soy/html2-trinket](http://dojo.soy/html2-trinket) to sign up.

2. To work through the examples in the Sushi Cards, **Remix** this trinket: [dojo.soy/html2-website-start](http://dojo.soy/html2-website-start). Then click on your username and go to "My Trinkets". You will see the remixed project there. Open it and change the name if you like, then click "Save".

3. The Sushi Cards mainly use examples from the above trinket, but if you prefer you can work with a website that you already made, for example the one that you made in the Beginner HTML and CSS series. To make a copy of your own website in Trinket, open it and click the "Duplicate" button. Change the name if you like, and then click "Save".

4. Just above the tabs in the code panel, click the icon and select either "Click to Run" or "Autorun".
   * _Click to Run_: Recommended. Any time you have made changes to your code, click the button to see the results.
   * _Autorun_: Your website will be automatically updated every time you make a change to the code. It doesn't always wait for you to stop typing, so this usually results in a lot of flashing of the page while you type! It also thinks there's errors when you haven't finished typing yet, which can be confusing.
